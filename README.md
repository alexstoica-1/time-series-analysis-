# Stochastic Pocesses & Other Stuff

This repo is my personal learning journey of Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and Simulations in Python, with an emphasis on applications in financial markets. I will log here (when I will remember) some of my advancements, like a little jurnal.

Today I implemented ***Brownian Motion*** simulations starting from ***Random Walks***. 
Also, learned about ***Geometric BM*** and some of its applications.

Worked a bit on ***Geometric BM*** for equity price prediction, worked well as a beginner method, but constant volatility and constant mean clearly is no the way towards good models, ran a ***Monte Carlo Simulation*** as well to see how it behaves.

Moved the other simulations that I have worked on in `notebooks/stocahstic_simulations`, nothing special for now, just how to sample random variables and a simple approximation of pi.
